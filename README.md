oToday I learned the fundamentals of Kubernetes and the main problems it solves in real-world infrastructure.
🔹 Why Kubernetes is needed (Problems it solves)
Container lifecycle management

🔹 Important Control Plane Components
kube-scheduler
→ Schedules pods on available nodes
Controller Manager
→ 

→ Example: restart controller (state management)
Cloud Controller Manager
🔹 Controllers & State Management
Controllers continuously watch the current state and make sure the desired state is always maintained.
Example: restarting failed containers automatically.
🔹 Leader Election (Leader Detection Algorithm)
Leader election is used so that only one active controller instance manages a task at a time.
This avoids conflicts in distributed systems and is configured at the control-plane component level.
🔹 Linux Namespace (Related Concept)
Linux namespaces are used for isolation of:
processes
network
filesystem
users
Kubernetes uses Linux namespaces internally for container isolation.
🔹 Monitoring & Observability Tools (Explored)
Datadog
Dynatrace
Sumo LogicDifferent HTML on Port 80 and Port 8080

This project demonstrates how a single machine can serve different HTML pages on different ports.

🔧 How it works

Port 80 → Serves index.html

Port 8080 → Serves index8080.html

🧪 Test using curl
curl localhost
curl localhost:8080

📚 What you’ll learn

Basics of ports & networking

How web servers handle multiple services

Practical usage of curl

Real-world server configuration concept
🚀 FastAPI Setup using pipx & Uvicorn

Today I learned how to set up and run a FastAPI application using pipx and uvicorn.

✔ Installed pipx for isolated Python tools  
✔ Installed FastAPI with standard dependencies  
✔ Used uvicorn to run the application  
✔ Learned how to run the server with reload and multiple workers  
✔ Practiced basic Linux commands and networking check using ss

Commands practiced:
- sudo apt update
- sudo apt install pipx
- pipx install "fastapi[standard]"
- pipx inject uvicorn fastapi
- uvicorn main:app --reload
- uvicorn main:app --workers 2
- ss -ntlp

This is part of my backend development learning journey.
